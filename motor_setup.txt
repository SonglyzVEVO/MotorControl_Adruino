Motor Control Setup
Connect 5V and ground of the IC to 5V and ground of Arduino.
Connect the motor to pins 2 and 3 of the IC.
Connect IN1 of the IC to pin 8 of Arduino.
Connect IN2 of the IC to pin 9 of Arduino.
Connect EN1 of IC to pin 2 of Arduino.
Connect SENS A pin of IC to the ground.
Connect the Arduino using Arduino USB cable and upload the program to the Arduino using Arduino IDE software or Arduino Web Editor.
Provide power to the Arduino board using power supply, battery or USB cable.
The motor should now run first in the clockwise (CW) direction for 3 seconds and then counter-clockwise (CCW) for 3 seconds.
